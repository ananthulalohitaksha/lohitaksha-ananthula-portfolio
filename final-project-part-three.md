# The final data story
[Protein, Reimagined: The Vegetarian Way](https://preview.shorthand.com/pUW7gJLq5nUuSiKG)

# Changes made since Part II
After completing Part II, I focused on refining the flow, structure, and clarity of my Shorthand story based on peer feedback and interview insights. I realized that the story had grown quite long, so I added a navigation bar to divide findings into clear sections, making it easier for users to browse. I also introduced section titles before each content block to improve the story’s professionalism and readability.

One of the key slides, addressing the common concern about protein intake on a vegetarian diet, originally felt cluttered due to styling issues. I split it into two slides: one introducing the concern and another conveying how I plan to address this concern. This change made the transition more effective.

In the meal comparison section, the feedback I received indicated that displaying both breakfast and dinner comparisons together was overwhelming. I separated them into two slides and highlighted a key takeaway for each, making the message easier to grasp. I added themed visuals — a sunlight background for breakfast and evening lights for dinner — to create a subtle narrative arc that reflects the time of day.

I also revised the "Chronic Diseases with Lower Risk in Vegetarians" visualization. The original bar chart was hard to interpret, according to the second round of interviews conducted, so I replaced it with a simple table listing the four conditions and the corresponding risk reduction, improving clarity and accessibility.

Incorporated changes based on first round of interviews:

1. Defined medical terms like "vascular disease" and "relative risk" for people who didn’t know what these meant.
2. Included a high-protein dish featuring soya chunks in the Global Bites section. Soya chunks were the top protein source in my first chart — “How Much Protein? Comparing Vegetarian and Meat Sources (per 100g).”
3. Made sure all ten dishes displayed in the Global Bites section take under 30 minutes to prepare and cost under $10, aligning with feedback on time and affordability.

For visual styling, I used a clean, high-contrast color palette:

1. Green for plant-based options
2. Red for meat-based options
3. White or black for titles and text

Overall, I believe these choices helped clearly differentiate between protein types while maintaining visual balance and readability.

## The audience

My target audience remained the same as defined in Part II: high-meat consumers open to reducing meat intake for health, environmental, or personal reasons. Early in the project, I considered addressing a broader audience, but realized that trying to convince committed meat-eaters would likely be ineffective. Instead, I focused on those already contemplating dietary change, where the story could make a real impact.

Insights from interviews with three meat-eating graduate students helped shape my focus. All interviewees expressed interest in vegetarian options but highlighted barriers like unfamiliar foods and lack of time to cook. Their input led to several key updates, including simplified language, cost-effective recipes, and structural changes that enhanced both clarity and engagement.

# Final thoughts

I'm proud and happy of the final product. While I had previous experience working with Power BI, this project pushed me to explore Tableau for visualizations and Shorthand for storytelling — both of which proved to be powerful tools for communicating data effectively.

One of the most valuable parts of this process was the in-class user interviews. The insights I gained helped me overcome creative roadblocks and refine the project to better suit the target audience. Their suggestions on layout and content improved the final outcome.

This was a time-intensive but rewarding project. I spent a good amount of time not only designing visuals but also making the story practical and relatable. For example, to estimate the cost of the ten global vegetarian dishes, I used Walmart.com, Google, and data from the recipe links included in the story. It was a bit tedious, but important as affordability matters to the audience.

Overall, I now feel more confident using Tableau and Shorthand for data storytelling.
