# Data Storytelling & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio features a series of data-driven narratives and design critiques developed during my graduate studies at **Carnegie Mellon University**. My work focuses on bridging the gap between complex datasets and human-centered design to drive informed decision-making.

## 🚀 Featured Story: [Protein, Reimagined: The Vegetarian Way](https://preview.shorthand.com/pUW7gJLq5nUuSiKG)
**Core Focus:** Health & Environmental Sustainability
*An interactive, long-form narrative created in Shorthand exploring the nutritional viability and environmental benefits of plant-based protein.*

### 🛠️ The Development Process
The final product was developed through a rigorous three-stage iterative design process:

* **[Phase 1: Data Discovery & User Storyboarding](./final-project-part-one.md)**: Identifying core datasets (USDA, Our World in Data) and mapping out the narrative arc to address specific audience hesitations.
* **[Phase 2: User Research & Wireframing](./final-project-part-two.md)**: Conducting qualitative interviews with target users to test initial sketches and refine the visual hierarchy for maximum impact.
* **[Phase 3: Final Synthesis & Refinement](./final-project-part-three.md)**: Integrating feedback to improve clarity, accessibility, and the overall storytelling flow before final deployment to Shorthand.

## 📊 Design & Analytics Case Studies

### 1. [Global Fiscal Health: Visualizing Government Debt](./visualizing-government-debt.md)
**Goal:** Identifying global economic trends following the 2008 financial crisis.
* **Techniques:** Heatmaps, Bubble Charts, and Time-Series Analysis.
* **Outcome:** Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard that highlights the divergent recovery paths of major economies, with a specific focus on the resilience of export-heavy markets.

### 2. [Iterative Design: Coffee Caffeine Content Critique](./critique-by-design.md)
**Goal:** Redesigning a complex table into a user-centric interactive tool.
* **Techniques:** User Research (Interviews), Wireframing, and Interactive Filtering.
* **Outcome:** Transformed a static table into a personalized caffeine tracker. This case study details the full UX process—from initial critique and student interviews to a finalized, high-contrast Tableau visualization that alerts users when they exceed safe caffeine thresholds.

## 🛠 Project Lifecycle Mastery
My portfolio demonstrates proficiency in the end-to-end data storytelling process:
1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Extracting insights from public datasets (OECD, USDA, FDA).
2.  **Design Critique:** Evaluating visualizations for clarity, accessibility, and intuitive design.
3.  **User Research:** Conducting interviews to validate wireframes and refine visual hierarchy.
4.  **Final Synthesis:** Deploying interactive stories using **Tableau**, **Shorthand**, and **Python**.
