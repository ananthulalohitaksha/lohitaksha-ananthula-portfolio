# Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my work for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University.

# About me

Hi! My name is Lohitaksha Ananthula, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University, with a focus on Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. I have a solid foundation in machine learning, data analysis, and predictive modeling. I’ve worked on projects where I engineered data pipelines, developed predictive models for demand forecasting, and created interactive dashboards to visualize insights.

I’m passionate about healthcare data analytics. I aim to leverage my expertise in data science and machine learning to enhance patient care, optimize operational efficiency, and support data-driven decision-making in the healthcare sector.

Apart from my academic and professional pursuits, I love hiking and playing cricket.

# What I hope to learn
Through this course, I want to be able to:

1. Effectively use data visualization techniques to tell compelling stories to my audience.
2. Craft narratives using data that make complex topics more accessible.
3. Gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques to create interactive data visualizations.

After graduation, I aspire to become a Data Scientist. I’m excited to tackle projects that involve data science and machine learning. I look forward to working with diverse teams and continuing to deepen my technical skills while making a tangible impact.
