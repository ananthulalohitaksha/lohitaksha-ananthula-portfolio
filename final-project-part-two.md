# User research 

## Target audience

My story is designed to reach high-meat consumers who are open to cutting back for health, environmental, or personal reasons. A common hesitation among this group is concern about getting enough protein. The goal is to help them take a first step toward a more plant-forward diet by showing that vegetarian meals can be protein-rich and easy to prepare.

For user research, I plan to interview frequent meat-eaters who are exploring plant-based options. Iâ€™ll reach out to friends and classmates who regularly eat meat, including those who have expressed interest in cutting back or are simply open to learning more about vegetarian alternatives. These interviews will offer valuable insights into the concerns, motivations, and reactions of the intended audience.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Understand perceptions of vegetarian vs. meat protein.    |        When you think about protein, do you usually associate it more with meat or vegetarian foods? After seeing this comparison chart, did anything change your perspective?          |
|    Test reactions to vegetarian vs. meat meals.  |         Looking at the breakfast and dinner comparisons, do the vegetarian options seem as satisfying as the meat ones? Why or why not?         |
|      |                  |
