# User research 

## Target audience

My story is designed to reach high-meat consumers who are open to cutting back for health, environmental, or personal reasons. A common hesitation among this group is concern about getting enough protein. The goal is to help them take a first step toward a more plant-forward diet by showing that vegetarian meals can be protein-rich and easy to prepare.

For user research, I plan to interview frequent meat-eaters who are exploring plant-based options. I’ll reach out to friends and classmates who regularly eat meat, including those who have expressed interest in cutting back or are simply open to learning more about vegetarian alternatives. These interviews will offer valuable insights into the concerns, motivations, and reactions of the intended audience.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Understand perceptions of vegetarian vs. meat protein.    |        When you think about protein, do you usually associate it more with meat or vegetarian foods? After seeing this comparison chart, did anything change your perspective?          |
|    Test reactions to vegetarian vs. meat meals.  |         Looking at the breakfast and dinner comparisons, do the vegetarian options seem as satisfying as the meat ones? Why or why not?         |
|    Evaluate clarity and impact of the health benefits data.  |            Does the chart showing health benefits of a vegetarian diet make the message clear? Was anything in it confusing or hard to trust? What would help you feel more confident in the information?     |
|   Gauge response to the call to action.    |        After going through the story, would you consider trying a vegetarian-based meal or something like “Meatless Monday”? What would encourage you to actually give it a try?         |

## Interview findings
I interviewed three students in their early 20s. Two are friends from the Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) program, and the third is a classmate from the Master of Public Policy and Management program. All three are regular meat-eaters but expressed varying levels of interest in exploring vegetarian-based meals.

| Questions               | Interview 1  | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| When you think about protein, do you usually associate it more with meat or vegetarian foods? After seeing this comparison chart, did anything change your perspective? |        I usually think of meat first, but seeing soya chunks at the top was surprising. It definitely made me reconsider how powerful veg proteins can be.      | Honestly, I’ve always thought of meat as the main protein source. I had never even heard of paneer before — the chart made me realize I’ve been underestimating vegetarian options like lentils and other foods.           |    Meat comes to mind first, but that soya number was wild. I didn't expect it to outweigh chicken and pork.         |
|                 Looking at the breakfast and dinner comparisons, do the vegetarian options seem as satisfying as the meat ones? Why or why not?         |            The tofu scramble looks pretty good actually, and the fiber is way higher than I expected. I'd probably try it with some seasoning.                    |        The Beyond Burger looked okay, but I wasn't sure if it would taste the same. Maybe more familiar veggie options would help.     |        They looked fine, but I might want on the side to feel full. Maybe a drink or fruit too.     |
|                   Does the chart showing health benefits of a vegetarian diet make the message clear? Was anything in it confusing or hard to trust? What would help you feel more confident in the information?        |           The chart was convincing but maybe adding more clarity on what 'relative risk' means would help. Numbers were strong, though.                     |      I got the message, but I didn’t know what 'vascular disease' means. The chart looks good overall, but adding short definitions for terms like that could help a broader audience understand it better.       |      The chart is nice — the data was clear.       |
| After going through the story, would you consider trying a vegetarian-based meal or something like “Meatless Monday”? What would encourage you to actually give it a try?  |        Yeah, I would like try Meatless Monday. A simple weekly plan or grocery list might make it easier to follow through.     | I would try it, but only if I could prep it in under 30 minutes. I don't have a lot of time during the day.     |    I might try it, especially if the protein intake is similar to meat based foods.        |
