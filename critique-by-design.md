# Critique by Design

## Step one: the visualization

While exploring various articles on the Makeover Monday website, I came across the "High Street Coffee Caffeine Content Compared" visualization, which illustrated caffeine levels across popular coffee chains. I selected this particular data visualization as I was looking for a graphic that conveyed an important message but lacked effective visualization. The visualization stood out because it provided valuable insights for coffee drinkers, helping them understand how much caffeine they consume from different coffee chains.

## Step two: the critique

As I assessed the "High Street Coffee Caffeine Content" visualization, I realized it effectively conveyed important information but still had areas for improvement. Here is my critique-

**_Observations_:**

Looking at the high street coffee caffeine content visualization, one thing that immediately stood out to me was the huge difference in caffeine levels between Costa's cappuccino (325 mg) and Starbucks' version (66 mg). On the other hand, I really liked how the table is presented in a neat and organized manner, with coffee chain names as rows and coffee types as columns, making comparisons easier. The use of a blue background with white text ensures good readability and creates an effective contrast.
However, I noticed a few issues. The filter/brewed coffee columns for Café Nero and Costa (Signature Blend) are missing, creating an impression of incompleteness. I also believe the visualization could have been improved by including the recommended daily caffeine intake for adults, as this would help compare the caffeine content of each drink to the suggested limit. Lastly, the visualization currently displays caffeine content in mg alongside drink size in ml, but this isn't very intuitive. Readers might find it clearer if it showed how much caffeine each drink contains.

**_Primary Audience_:**

The primary audience appears to be consumers who regularly purchase coffee from high street chains and want to be informed about caffeine content in their drinks.
This visualization is moderately effective for the audience because it provides clear, factual information in an organized format. The table layout makes it easy to compare caffeine levels across different chains and drink types. However, it could better serve the audience by making the information more intuitive and visually engaging. The current approach requires calculations to understand relative differences and lacks information on which options might exceed recommended caffeine content per day. I also believe that most coffee consumers would find it easier to understand caffeine content in terms of each drink's caffeine amount, rather than comparing caffeine content in mg and drink size in ml.

**_Recommendations for improving the current visualization:_**

In my redesign, I plan to move from a table format to a horizontal bar chart, which can make the information more visually engaging and easier to compare at a glance. I might explore using coffee chain logos to make the visualization more appealing. I also plan to reorganize the data by grouping the coffee drinks based on the highest caffeine content, rather than sorting them alphabetically by chain. To provide better context, I would include a reference line indicating the FDA/health authority’s recommended caffeine limit of 400 mg per day. Furthermore, I plan on incorporating a dropdown filter that allows users to select the type of coffee, the desired number of cups, and even customize the drink size. This would involve some mathematical calculations to ensure accuracy. I believe these changes could enhance both the clarity and the overall impact of the visualization.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

As I worked through my critique of the "High Street Coffee Caffeine Content" visualization, I initially thought it would be fairly easy to improve. However, as I started redesigning it, I realized that the changes I wanted to make, especially with the custom calculations and dropdown menus, felt more challenging than expected. Despite these challenges, I created a sketch for my redesign. My goal was to move away from the table format and use a more intuitive bar chart.

However, I didn’t post my redesign on Tableau Public yet, as I wasn’t fully confident in the final version. I wanted to take the time to gather feedback by conducting interviews and adding my own thoughts further to work on the final redesign. Here is my sketch:

## Step four: Test the solution

I interviewed two students in their early 20s—one from the Master of Information Systems Management program and another, an undergraduate Computer Science student.

I conducted the interviews based on the following questions:

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

**_Results:_**

**Interviewee 1-**

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

A bar chart showing how much caffeine each type of coffee contains across different chains.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

A visualization that helps determine whether we are hitting, exceeding, or staying within the recommended caffeine intake by comparing the same type of coffee across different chains.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

The write-up below the title mentions what is considered a safe caffeine intake per day for adults. However, the threshold is just a line, which makes it slightly confusing. X-axis labels are also missing.

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

Since popular coffee chains are included, I believe this is meant for regular coffee drinkers who want to keep track of their caffeine intake.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Add an axis label and define the threshold with a number. The dropdown menu for drink types has large size options, which don't look great. A more effective title would make it more intuitive for the reader to understand the message.
 
**_Synthesis:_ **

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
